  <h2>
    Trees, Heaps, and Advanced Algorithmic Problems
  </h2>
  <p>
    This project is the third assignment for the Data Structures course. It focuses on the implementation of tree-based data structures like <strong>Heaps</strong>, <strong>Huffman Trees</strong>, and <strong>Binary Search Trees</strong>, and applies these concepts to solve several complex algorithmic challenges.

      <h3>
        Problem 1: Warm-up (Core Data Structures)
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first part of the assignment is a hands-on implementation of three fundamental data structures from scratch, based on a provided template.

          <strong>Implemented Structures</strong>
        </summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Min-Heap</strong>: With core operations like <code>heap_push</code>, <code>heap_pop</code>, <code>bubble_up</code>, <code>bubble_down</code>, and required error handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Huffman Tree</strong>: Capable of being built from character frequencies or directly from a text to calculate compressed length.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong>: Including <code>insert</code> and three traversal methods: <code>preorder</code>, <code>inorder</code>, and <code>postorder</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>
        Problem 2: Median Horses
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem involves solving the "median in a data stream" challenge. The goal is to efficiently find and report the median price from a dynamically changing list of horse prices, which is a classic application of using two heaps (a min-heap and a max-heap).

      <h3>
        Problem 3: Points on a Line
      </h3>
      <p>
        A computational geometry problem that requires processing a set of line segments. The task is to count, for each integer <em>k</em>, how many integer points on the number line are covered by exactly <em>k</em> segments. This is efficiently solvable using a sweep-line algorithm.

      <h3>
        Problem 4: The Beggar Post Office
      </h3>
      <p>
        A string processing challenge focused on concatenating a sequence of words with maximum overlap to minimize the total length. For each new word, the longest prefix matching a suffix of the existing text is found and removed before concatenation, a task suited for algorithms like KMP.
