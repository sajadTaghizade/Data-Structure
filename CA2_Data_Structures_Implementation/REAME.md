      <h3>
        Problem 1: Warm-up (Data Structure Implementation)
      </h3>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this part is to implement three fundamental data structures from scratch based on a provided template.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>
          <strong>Implemented Data Structures</strong>
        </summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Queue</strong>: A First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure with methods like <code>enqueue</code> and <code>dequeue</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stack</strong>: A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure with methods like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and dynamic capacity expansion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Linked List</strong>: A linear data structure with methods for inserting nodes at the front/back and reversing the list.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>
        Problem 2: The Refactor Man (Code Refactoring)
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem involves refactoring a piece of code written in a custom language called "Painthon" to reduce its indentation depth. The task is to replace every nested <code>if</code> block with a new function call, effectively flattening the code structure.

      <h3>
        Problem 3: Sewer Battle (Rat Collision)
      </h3>
      <p>
        A line of rats, each with a specific power and direction (positive for right, negative for left), move in a sewer pipe. When two rats collide, the one with the lower power is eliminated. If their powers are equal, both are eliminated. The goal is to determine which rats survive the series of collisions.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Problem 4: The Night Book (Sliding Window Maximum)
      </h3>
      <p>
        This problem simulates finding the most "attractive" book from a shelf in the dark. Given a list of book attractiveness scores and a window size <code>k</code>, the task is to find the maximum value within each sliding window of size <code>k</code> as it moves across the list.

      <h3>
        Problem 5: Inverted City (Reverse Nodes in k-Group)
      </h3>
      <p>
        In a city represented by a linked list of houses, the king decides to reverse the order of houses in groups of size <code>x</code>. The task is to implement this reversal for a given linked list and group size, leaving any final, smaller group unmodified.
